Introduction
------------

The Open Energy Efficiency Meter is an engine for measurement and verification
of energy savings across and between energy efficiency programs for both
commercial and residential applications. At its core, this package is a
framework for specifying how efficiency metrics should be calculated from raw
energy usage data. It is flexible enough to meet the needs of different program
implementers without sacrificing the ability to standardize on particular
models and methods.
