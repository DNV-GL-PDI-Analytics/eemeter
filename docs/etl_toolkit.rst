ETL Toolkit
-----------

The ETL toolkit is provided to assist moving data from its source into the
datastore.

"ETL" stands for Extract-Transform-Load. These three steps outline the
actions the ETL toolkit helps with and are as follows:

- Extract: obtain data from an external (non-datastore) source.

- Transform: convert that data into a form usable the datatore.

- Load: move the transformed data into the datastore.
