Methods Overview
----------------

As described in the :ref:`introduction` (which you should read if you haven't
already):

    The OpenEEmeter calculates energy savings in real time by selecting a
    sample of consumption data prior to an intervention, weather-normalizing
    it to establish a baseline, and calculating the difference between
    projected energy usage and actual energy usage following an intervention.

This basic method[#]_ is used in combination with a number of models, which are
described loosely in this guide and in detail in the provided references.


.. [#] Additional information on *why* this method is used in preference to
   other methods is described in the introduction.
