Datastore
---------

The datastore is an application for housing energy and project data which
provides a REST API for loading data, computing energy savings, and
inspecting results. Like the eemeter library, the datastore is open source and
available on `github <https://github.com/impactlab/oeem-energy-datastore>`_
under an MIT license.

The datastore uses the `django web framework <https://djangoproject.com/>`_
with a `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database.
