.. _glossary-baseline-period:

- **baseline period**: a time period before a
  :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>` of interest for which to model, observe,
  or estimate :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`.
  Generally used in reference to a set of
  :ref:`reporting periods <glossary-reporting-period>`.

.. _glossary-building-performance:

- **building performance**: see :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`.

.. _glossary-end-use:

- **end use**: an energy-consuming service such as lighting, space cooling,
   space heating, refrigeration, or water heating, particularly as provided by
   a building or set of buildings.

.. _glossary-end-use-demand:

- **end use demand**: the extent to which an :ref:`end use <glossary-end-use>`
  is needed. May vary by season, occupancy, time of day, day of week, or
  purpose of building.

.. _glossary-energy-demand:

- **energy demand**: the amount of energy needed to satisfy
  :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>`.

.. _glossary-energy-savings:

- **energy savings**: an increase in
  :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`
  indicating lower :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` for equivalent
  :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>`.

.. _glossary-energy-performance:

- **energy performance**: the extent to which
  :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>` causes
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>`. Higher performance
  indicates lower energy demand for equivalent end use demand. Sometimes
  referred to as :ref:`building performance <glossary-building-performance>`.

.. _glossary-demand-capacity:

- **demand capacity**: the extent to which
  :ref:`energy-performance <glossary-energy-performance>` increases from a
  baseline for a :ref:`reporting period <glossary-reporting-period>`
  following an :ref:`intervention <glossary-intervention>`.

.. _glossary-energy-efficiency-project:

- **energy efficiency project**: a set of
  :ref:`interventions <glossary-intervention>` designed to reduce overall
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` relative to
  equivalent :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>`.

.. _glossary-demand-response-project:

- **demand response project**: a set of
  :ref:`interventions <glossary-intervention>` designed to shift the time of
  day or day of week of
  :ref:`energy-demand <glossary-energy-demand>`, generally toward off-peak
  hours.

.. _glossary-intervention:

- **intervention**: a set of upgrades or performance improvements on physical
  infrastructure of an existing building
  (see :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>`), or of behavior of individuals
  living in an existing building.

.. _glossary-project:

- **project**: an :ref:`intervention <glossary-intervention>` or
  :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>` for which there is an expected change in
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>`.

.. _glossary-reporting-period:

- **reporting period**: a time period after a
  :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>` of interest over which to model,
  observe, or estimate :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`.
  Generally used in reference to a
  :ref:`baseline period <glossary-baseline-period>`.

.. _glossary-retrofit:

- **retrofit**: a set of :ref:`interventions <glossary-intervention>` taking
  place at a particular building or site.

.. _glossary-trace:

- **trace**: a single time series of measured values associated with units at
  a particular (not necessarily fixed) frequency.
